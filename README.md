## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gigimushroom/mushroom_os.git
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Follow [https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/tools.html](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/tools.html) to build tool chains
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```bash
make && make qemu
```
