# Buffer Cache



1. Sync access to disk blocks to ensure only one copy of a block in memory and only one kernel thread can use this copy. 

2. Cache popular blocks See `bio.c` **Source code**

```c
struct buf {
  int valid;   // has data been read from disk?
  int disk;    // does disk “own” buf?
  uint dev;
  uint blockno;
  struct sleeplock lock;
  uint refcnt;
  struct buf *prev; // LRU cache list
  struct buf *next;
  uchar data[BSIZE];
};
```

```c
struct {
  struct spinlock lock;
  struct buf buf[NBUF];

  // Linked list of all buffers, through prev/next.
  // head.next is most recently used.
  struct buf head;
} bcache;
```
